    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li> 8 ounces feta cheese, crumbled</li>
        
            <li> 3 tablespoons finely chopped green onions</li>
                
            <li> 1 egg, beaten</li>
                
            <li> 1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
                
            <li> 1 egg yolk, beaten with 1 teaspoon water</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li> Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        
            <li> In a small bowl, blend feta cheese, green onions, and egg. Cut pastry into 12 (3 inch) squares. Place a mounded tablespoon of feta mixture in the center of each square. Moisten edges with water, and fold pastry over filling to form a triangle. Press edges together firmly with a fork to seal. Lightly brush pastries with the egg yolk mixture.</li>
                
            <li> Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
